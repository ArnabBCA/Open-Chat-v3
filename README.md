## FAQs

#### Question 1 Is the Sign in process secure?

The signin process is done by following the official signin method by Google. We donnot have the access to your passwords or modify your email account.

#### Question 2 Is my data secure?

We don't reccomend to send any private message as everybody can see it who are connected in this app.

#### Question 3 For how long the messages are kept?

Due to firebase limitations on free plan messages cannot be backed up. We will try not to delete the messages but if in the future there is need of new database the messages will be deleated.
